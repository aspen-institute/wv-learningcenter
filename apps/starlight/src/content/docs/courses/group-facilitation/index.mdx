In this module, you will learn the transformation practice of gathering people in your community in conversation. We believe that relationships are the foundation to weaving and to building sustainable change for our neighborhoods. Having a conversation and sharing our personal stories across lines of identity and ideological difference can help us see ourselves more clearly and can help us build a more full understanding of the story of our communities. To help you lead these conversations, you will learn How to Prepare for the Conversation, Basic Facilitation Skills, and What to do When Things Get Hard. Our partner, The People’s Supper, will take you step-by-step through this process, with videos, activities, and downloadable guides to help you, whether you’re bridging divides, building community, or strengthening relationships in your neighborhood.
