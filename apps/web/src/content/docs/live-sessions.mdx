## Public Speaking

Strong storytelling skills help you share your message with diverse audiences and have impact. This 2-session training with a coach from Story District will help you master the art of storytelling. Whether you are a community leader, educator, activist, or simply someone who believes in the power of connection, this program will help you move and motivate others. It is ideal for those passionate about healing divides, inspiring others, and creating a sense of belonging.

Here's what you will learn in the first two-hour session:

- **Weaving stories into your talks**: Captivate and inspire your audience by weaving narratives that resonate deeply.
- **Finding your story "seeds"**: Learn how to identify and develop story ideas from your own life experiences.
- **Crafting a captivating narrative**: Learn to create stories that hold the audience's attention from beginning to end.
- **Tuning your talk to the audience**: Learn how to identify your audience and clarify your storytelling objectives.

In the second, one-hour workshop, you’ll engage in pairs and small groups to share and refine your stories, gaining practical experience and feedback.
