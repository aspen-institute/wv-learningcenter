Thank you for your interest in a live Learning Center Workshop. We have no upcoming workshops at this time, but hope to add more in the future. Many modules contain recordings to previous workshops, so we invite you to watch those as you go through the content.
Multiple Learning Center courses offer upcoming live sessions, with live discussion and Q&A with fellow Weavers and course leaders.

**To get the most out of each session, please complete the lesson before attending your course.** More information and registration is available within each course, linked below.

## Public Speaking

Strong storytelling skills help you share your message with diverse audiences and have impact. This 2-session training with a coach from Story District will help you master the art of storytelling. Whether you are a community leader, educator, activist, or simply someone who believes in the power of connection, this program will help you move and motivate others. It is ideal for those passionate about healing divides, inspiring others, and creating a sense of belonging.

Here's what you will learn in the first two-hour session:

- **Weaving stories into your talks**: Captivate and inspire your audience by weaving narratives that resonate deeply.
- **Finding your story "seeds"**: Learn how to identify and develop story ideas from your own life experiences.
- **Crafting a captivating narrative**: Learn to create stories that hold the audience's attention from beginning to end.
- **Tuning your talk to the audience**: Learn how to identify your audience and clarify your storytelling objectives.

In the second, one-hour workshop, youâ€™ll engage in pairs and small groups to share and refine your stories, gaining practical experience and feedback.
