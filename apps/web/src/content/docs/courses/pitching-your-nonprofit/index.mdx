Nonprofits occupy a unique niche in our society. No one - not the founder, the staff, or the board - **owns** a nonprofit. Nonprofit leaders govern their organizations on behalf of the community they serve. Part of the work we do as nonprofit leaders is to communicate with community members about the work that’s being done in our nonprofits and the need that still exists. This module, Pitching Your Nonprofit, will help you tell your nonprofit’s story succinctly and effectively.
