What does “care” mean to you, in your life, based on your experiences? What is it that you _do_ in day-to-day life that contributes to the wellbeing of others, and likewise what is that others _do_ for you that contributes to your wellbeing? What have been significant actions of care over the course of your life? And how does the space you’re in remind you of such care?

These are the questions we’ll explore in this unit. Your observations will form the foundation for visualizing care in your life.

  Before you do the exercises we have developed, take a moment to notice what is already in your mind. Pause and observe the care that surrounds you. Where do you notice acts of care in your daily life? Consider the different ways care manifests in your environment and who provides and receives such care.

## Exercise: Recent Care Experiences

For this exercise, review your last couple of days and write down a list of actions you observed that were meant to care for others, to support or increase their wellbeing, in ways small and large. These include things you did as well as those done by others around you.

Here are two examples, one capturing care activities at home, and the other at work.

<div class="soft-row">
  <Picture src={atHomeImage} alt="Handwritten list: AT HOME / Helped dad organize meds / Calmed dad when he got frustrated / Dad made me coffee and a fresh batch of cookies / Ellen called to chat / Neighbor John mowed the lawn / Patty took dad to a show" />
  <Picture src={atWorkImage} alt="Handwritten list: AT WORK / Sue brought in coffee and donuts for the team / Henry commiserated on the contract delays / May improved my graphics / I mentored a couple of interns on career choices / I helped James plan his team's offsite" />
</div>

Next, using the Care In Your Life worksheet, reflect on care you have experienced (given and received) over time. As circumstances changed, the nature, intensity, and frequency of care activities likely changed as well. Recent or particularly noteworthy activities may jump to your mind immediately, while others may surface more slowly.

## Exercise: Exploring Your Care Space

After putting pen to paper, it’s now time to go out and explore our spaces of care. When asked, "where do you experience care?” there are a variety of spaces that might come to mind. Maybe it's the hospital, the house you grew up in, the gym, or even your desk. Care can happen anywhere. Where do you experience care?
