In this module you will learn how to have more awareness and clarity on the web of care and connection in your life—who is caring for whom and how. You will learn a variety of exercises to become more observant of acts of care in day-to-day living. You will learn to create an Atlas CareMap, a diagram of your care ecosystem, and personalize it for your own needs. And you will learn to use these tools to better connect with others in your life.
