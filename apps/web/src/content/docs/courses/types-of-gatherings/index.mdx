As much as we love thinking about the substance of a conversation, and what might be possible when you get a particular group of people together, what happens when you bring people together is also impacted by all the conditions they are gathering in. The details matter. In this module, you will learn how to choose the right kind of gathering to meet the goals you have for your community. We’ll look at the difference between building community and creating connections, and how to choose whether to do a virtual or in-person meeting, an affinity or bridging gathering, and whether to do a one-off or a series of gatherings over time. Together, we’ll consider the possibilities and limits of each, so that you can walk away with a tool to discern when each one will help you to gather towards your particular end goal.

Our partner, [The People’s Supper,](https://thepeoplessupper.org/) will take you step-by-step through this process, with videos, activities, and downloadable guides to help you, whether you’re bridging divides, building community, or strengthening relationships in your neighborhood.

You can pause and pick up where you left off at any point, until the reflection. Once you complete the reflection, Weave staff will email you a Certificate of Completion.

We also invite you to discuss your learning and thoughts on how this content applies to weaving in our [online community](https://community.weavers.org/pages/welcome). You must be a member of the community to receive the certificate and post in the community. [Please join today](https://community.weavers.org/pages/welcome).
