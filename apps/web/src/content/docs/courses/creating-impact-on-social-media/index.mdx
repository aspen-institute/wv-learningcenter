In this module, you will learn how and where to share your story on social media, the best ways to engage your audience, and how to be accessible and equitable when posting and managing your content.

## Partner

This course was developed in partnership with **[Rise Collective](https://www.risecollective.us)**.

## Live Sessions

This lecture- and discussion-based session will teach participants how to create, manage, and engage with content on social media with a lens for equity and accessibility. There will be plenty of time for Q&A, so bring your questions about how to create impact on social media! To get the most out of this session, please complete the lesson before attending your course.** We will review some of the information from the equity and accessibility section of the course, but add in other steps and tips in the live sessions.
