We believe public speaking can be taught, and these six learning modules will help you discover what it takes to become a great speaker –  and offer you practical tools to support your growth as a speaker. The aim of this course is to help you inspire others to become partners in building more trusting and connected communities.

We will start by identifying your personal story,  and sharing it to help create trust and  credibility with your audience. We’ll discuss why it’s important to know your audience in order to  authentically connect and move your listeners to new perspectives and possibilities.

Through clarifying and sharpening your message, you will be able to offer the audience a memorable takeaway with a clear call to action. And by evaluating your performance, you will discover ways to keep a speech engaging and compelling. Finally, this course will help you with concrete strategies for continued growth as a speaker. 
 
Each of the six learning modules includes readings, videos, worksheets, and interactive quizzes.  
We look forward to supporting you on this journey to becoming a great public speaker!
