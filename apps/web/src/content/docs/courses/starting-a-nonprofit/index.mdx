Nonprofits occupy a unique niche in our society. Nonprofits are mission driven, not profit driven. They exist to accomplish positive good for the public or the environment. No one - not the founder, the staff, or the board - **owns** a nonprofit. Nonprofit leaders govern their organizations on behalf of the community they serve. If you’re considering starting a nonprofit, this course is designed to provide an overview of what’s involved as well as alternatives to the nonprofit business model.

This course is **not** intended to serve as legal or accounting advice. See the Resources section for more information.
