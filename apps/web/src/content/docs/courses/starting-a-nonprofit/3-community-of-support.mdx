title: Community of Support
---
If you’ve chosen a nonprofit structure, you’re committing to the work of engaging community members.  Once you formalize your nonprofit, these folks may become board members, advisors, participants, volunteers, or staff. At this point, you’re all co-creators! Convene this group based on your knowledge of their skills and their investment (personal or professional) in your community.

Once the group is gathered, you’ll find the Weave module on [Facilitating Groups](/courses/group-facilitation) helpful in planning and executing the activities in this section, both of which are intended to be done with a group.
