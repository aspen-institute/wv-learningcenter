Facilitation is a key skill in having conversations across your Community. When we think of the role of a facilitator and the skills of facilitation, it is important to remember that facilitators are there to guide participants through a conversation, not to manage the conversations. As a facilitator, we are not present to determine who may be right or wrong to pass judgment, but we’re there to listen and help participants find the best solutions. This course is designed as an overview to discover foundational facilitation skills.

## Live Sessions

This _Foundations of Facilitation_ live session will introduce participants to the foundational skills of Facilitation. We will work through uncovering our own biases and how to choose productive behaviors when tension arises in conversation. We will also review how to know and prepare for both your audience and participants and provide reference materials to use for your own future conversations. This session is highly participatory and will build upon the responses and engagement from the audience.
