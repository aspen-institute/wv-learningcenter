Facilitation is a key skill in having conversations across your Community. When we think of the role of a facilitator and the skills of facilitation, it is important to remember that facilitators are there to guide participants through a conversation, not to manage the conversations. As a facilitator, we are not present to determine who may be right or wrong to pass judgment, but we’re there to listen and help participants find the best solutions. This course is designed as an overview to discover foundational facilitation skills.
