As we begin to explore the role of a facilitator, it is important that we understand **Closed** vs. **Open** questions. In the role of a facilitator, we want to focus on the voice of the participants, not our own, which means we need to be skilled at asking questions. Closed and Open questions are two main types of questions that we will use during a session. A Closed question is a question that invites a short, usually one-word answer. You will also hear this referred to as a “yes or no” question. Open questions are questions that invite conversation from your audience.
